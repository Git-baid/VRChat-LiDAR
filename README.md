## About

### Walk around a completely dark environment with nothing but a scanner. This scanner is the only way to "see" your environment

### Find five randomly spawned buttons in your environment with your scanner and activate them. Sounds simple enough...

### ...but you might not be alone. The more buttons you activate, the more aggressive your environment becomes.
